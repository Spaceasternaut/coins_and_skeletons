# coins_and_skeletons
This is an import of my project so_long from School 21 (Ecole 42). This project is written in C, uses GCC and the minilibX - a small graphic library written by School 42 staff.

This is a 2D game of sorts where you have to collect all of the coins and not stumble upon skeletons along the way!

To compile the project, execute **make launch** command in the root repository of the pjoject.

If you want to try out different maps, use **./so_long_bonus < map >.ber**

Use **WASD** to move around, **ESC** to close the game.

Add your maps to the levels/ folder if you feel like it.

I will clean the project up once I have a bit more time, for now this is going to be a bit of a mess.

I am including the subject for the project along with the game just in case anyone is interested.

Thank you very much to [Tazmoe on itch.io](https://tazmoe.itch.io/bitrogue-basic) for the textures!
